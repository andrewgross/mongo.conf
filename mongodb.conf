# This specifies the configuration paramaters used by MongoDB at 
# launch. This configuration file is not automatically reloaded.  
# Changed to this file will not be reflected on the server until 
# it is restarted.

# This file contains command line options described at:

# To use a configuration file your MongoDB server must be started with
# the -f or --config option
# Ex: $ ./mongod --config=/opt/mongodb/conf/mongodb.conf

# Currently the configuration file does not recognize a server root, all 
# directory paths should be explicitly defined.  Where possible, 
# the default configuration options have been added as comments.

# This configuration file has been modeled after the Apache 2.2 httpd.conf

### Section 1: Database Options

# Directives in this section specify overarching options for MongoDB, 
# such as location of the database and listening options.
#

#
# Path to the MongoDB Database.  This is the directory where MongoDB 
# will store your data as well as file locks. This directory should 
# be already created by the user running MongoDB with appropriate 
# r/w permissions.
#
dbpath = /data/mongodb1

#
# To seperate each DB into explicit subdirectoriesof the main DB path,
# use the --directoryperdb option.  
# NOTE: This does not automagically migrate your existing DBs.  
# Any existing DBs will be ignored and new ones created in these directories.
# To migrate existing databases, you should shutdown, move the files manually,
# and restart the server with this option enabled.
#
# directoryperdb = false

# 
# Listening information.  This specifies the IP and ports that MongoDB
# should listen for connections.
#
bind_ip = 0.0.0.0
port = 27017

#
# Fork the server process.  This is useful to seperate the 
# MongoDB process from the call that starts the server. Recommended
# when launching MongoDB from the command line instead of a script.
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
fork = false

#
# HTTP Interface:
# The interface is enabled by default, and it can be turned off by
# using the --nohttpinterface
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# nohttpinterface = false

#
# Allow Extended Operations on the HTTP interface.  The interface 
# will be present on 28017 by default. 
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#

rest = false

#
# Repair Path:
# You can specify an alternate directory to store temporary data 
# during a database repair.  The default is the same as <dbpath>
#
# repairpath = <path>

#
# Database Security
# These two options enable or disable authentication to acess the
# database.  The default is no authentication.  It should be enabled
# for non-development databases.  This parameter should be explicitly
# defined as future versions of MongoDB may change this default.
#
# These switches only need to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant for operation.
#
# auth = false
#
noauth = true

#
# Quotas:
# This option enables DB Quota Management
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
# quota = false

#
# Quota Files:
# This option enforces a limit on the number of files per DB.
# Requires quotas be enabled.
#
# quotaFiles = <max>

#
# Small Files:
# This option forces MongoDB to use a smaller default file size.
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# smallfiles = false

#
# File Preallocation:
# This option causes MongoDB to not preallocate large chunks of space 
# for databases. 
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
# 
# noprealloc = false

#
# Namespace:
# MongoDB has a limit of approximately 24,000 namespaces per database.
# Each colelction and index counts as a namespace.  This can be increased
# with the --nssize parameter.  This will increase the size of the 
# <database>.ns file.  This option only effects new databases, to update
# exiting databases restart the server with this option and run the 
#
## db.repairDatabase()
#
# command from the shell.  The maximum size of the a .ns file is 2 GB
#
# nssize = <MB>

#
# Hints:
# This option caused MongoDB to ignore query hints/
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# nohints = false

#
# Maximum Number of Connections
# This increases the maximum number of connections available to
# MongoDB.  This is helpful if you get an error regarding 
# "too many open files" or "too many open connections"
# Additionally, you may want to increase the file descriptor 
# limit if you see this error. For more information:
#
# <URL:http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Too+Many+Open+Files>
#
#maxConns = 1000



### Section 2: Replication Options

#
# Replication Configuration: By default no replication is enabled, 
# although it is recommended that it be enacted in some form.  
# Information on MongoDB's replication options can be found at:
#
# <URL:http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replication>
#

#
# Replica Sets
# Replica Sets have been introduced in MongoDB v1.6.
# You should have at least 3+ servers in a replica set, preferable
# all actual servers, although an arbiter server can suffice if 
# necessary.  To start a server as part of a replica set specify
# the set name.
#
replSet = replica

#
# Replica Set Operations Logs
# The default size of the operations log for replica sets can be
# increased. By default it is 5% of disk space, with a
# minimum of 1 GB on 64-bit installs, and 50MB on 32-bit installs.
#
# oplogSize = <MB>


#
# Master-Slave Replication Options: These options must be specific 
# to each server's configuration file.  One configuration file 
# cannot describe both a master as well as it's slaves.  Modify 
# the configuration file appropriately for each server.
# More information on Master-Slave Replication can be found at:
#
# <URL:http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Master+Slave>
#


## Master Server:
# Designate this server as a master server for use in a 
# master-slave setup. For information on setting up a slave
# to serve multiple masters, see the Slave Server section.
#
# master = false


## Slave Server:
# Designate this server as a slave in a master-slave setup.  
#
# slave = false

#
# Source:
# You must specify the 'source' option when creating a slave server.  
#
# source = <masterhostname>[:<port>]
#
# NOTE: The DB path specified above is the location for the slave to 
# store its data, not that of the Master server.  The source server can 
# also be specified by adding an object to local.sources:
#
## bin/mongo <slavehostname>/local
## db.sources.find(); // confirms the collection is empty.  then:
## db.sources.insert( { host: <masterhostname>[:<port>] } );
#
# This method is useful if you want a slave to pull from multiple 
# upstream masters.  For more information on multi-master slaves, see:
# <URL:http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/One+Slave+Two+Masters>

#
# Auto Resync:
# Autoresync causes the slave server to automatically resync if the 
# data becomes stale.  When used, the slave server cannot resync 
# more than once every 10 minutes.  Normally, operator intervention
# is required to complete a resync. This switch only needs to be 
# present, the boolean value is currently irrelevant and must only 
# be present.
#
# autoresync = false

#
# Op Log File Size:
# The oplogSize command specifies the size of Operations Log from
# the master server.  By default it is 5% of disk space, with a
# minimum of 1 GB on 64-bit installs, and 50MB on 32-bit installs.
#
# oplogSize = <MB>

#
# Specific Database Replication:
# The slave server can be specified to only replicate a certain DB
# from the master server.  This uses the --only option.  The default
# is to replicate all databases.
#
# only = <db>

#
# Delayed Replication:
# A slave server can be set to replicate data from the master server
# with a time delay using the --slavedelay option.  The delay is
# specified in seconds.
#
# slavedelay = <seconds>



### Section 3: Logging Options

#
# Log Files:
# Location to write Mongodb log files.  The default is to write
# output to stdout.  Logs can be rotated by sending SIGUSR1 to
# the MongoDB server.
#
logpath = /data/mongodb/log/rs.log

#
# Log Appends:
# Append to existing logs, instead of overwriting.  The default
# is false since the default logpath is to stdout.  This 
# switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
logappend = true

#
# Log Verbosity:
# Add additional lines for increased verbosity
# The boolean switch is irrelevant, it must only be present
# to enable the next level of verbosity.  The entire line should
# be commented to reduce verbosity.  Default logging verbosity
# is zero.
#
# Currently using more than one verbose statement from the config
# file is not working properly.  Add the -vvvvv tag to the 
# command line statement for the same functionality.
 
#verbose = true
#verbose = true
#verbose = true
#verbose = true
#verbose = true

#
# Additional Logging:
# MongoDB can periodically log CPU and memory usage.  This 
# switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# cpu = false

#
# Operations Logging:
# Increased logging of the operations performed on the database.
# 0 = off (default)
# 1 = Writes
# 2 = Reads
# 3 = Both
# 7 = Writes and some reads
#
# diaglog = 3

#
# Quiet Logging:
# This option reduced the amount of log output.  Useful for 
# debugged production databases. This 
# switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# quiet = false


### Section 4: Debugging Options
#
# The options in this section are useful for developing 
# applications for use with MongoDB and initial setup of
# MongoDB in an environment.

#
# Object Checking
# This option causes MongoDB to inspect all client data for
# validity when it is received.
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# objcheck = false

#
# Cursors 
# MongoDB queries retain a cursor which can iterated to retrieve
# additional results.  They expire after approximately 10 minutes.
# Cursors can be turned off with this option.
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# nocursors = false

# 
# Scripting
# Server side scripting can be turned off if necessary.  This will
# result in greatly limited functionality.
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# noscripting = false

#
# Table Scans
# Table scans in MongoDB can be turned off.
# This switch only needs to be present, the boolean value is 
# currently irrelevant and must only be present.
#
# notablescans = false
